# Mechanical Power

Mechanical Power is a simple gear based system that can be used for many complex machines.

The first step to Mechanical Power is the [Hand Crank](../blocks/hand_crank.md) this allows for manually powering certain machines directly, such as the [Millstone](../blocks/mill.md), for early production.

The next step is to make continuous Mechanical Power through a Windmill, to do this a strong fibrous material is necessary.
[Hemp](../blocks/hemp.md) is exactly that, put this plant into the [Millstone](../blocks/mill.md) to create Hemp Fibers, to make [Rope](../items/rope.md) or [Fabric](../items/fabric.md).

Once enough Hemp Fiber is gathered, create a [Windmill](../blocks/windmill.md) to create continous Mechanical Power.
The Windmill must be placed on an [Axle](../blocks/axle.md) and need a 13x13 vertical area to be placed.

Now that you have a Windmill use Axles and Gearboxes to transfer Mechanical Power to as many machines as needed. 
Be careful though, the Windmill has one downside; When the Weather gets too rough the Windmill will rotate faster, this will eventually cause the first Gearbox connected to be overpowered and break. (Check [Gearbox](../blocks/gearbox.md) for more info)

With Continuous Mechanical Power now, more machines are available to use.

The next step to using Mechanical Power is [Tanned Leather](../items/tanned_leather.md), which is created in a [Cauldron](../blocks/cauldron.md).

A Cauldron requires a uninterrupted fire source in below it, this can be from burning netherrack or wood if you're really desperate.
Additionally, the more fire in the 3x3 around the center fire the faster the Cauldron will process.
Having a functional Cauldron opens up more possibilities, the creation of [Heating Elements](../items/element.md) and [Filaments](../items/filament.md) allow creating the [Hibachi](../blocks/hibachi.md) and [Light Blocks](../blocks/light.md) respectively,
as well as mass cooking of food and more.

With [Tanned Leather](../items/tanned_leather.md), Leather Belts can now be made to create more complex machines.

* The [Saw](../blocks/saw.md) gives access to better Log cutting as well as creating [Minimized Wood](../blocks/minimized_wood.md) for making more complex wooden items or can be used to automatically kill mobs.

* The [Filtered Hopper](../blocks/hopper.md) is a multi-purpose machine that can pick up items on top of it and be filtered with certain items to allow specified groups of items through (Find more in [Hopper Filters](../blocks/hopper.md)). It is required to create [Hellfire Dust](../items/hellfire.md) and later [Soul Urns](../blocks/soul_urn.md)

* The [Bellows](../blocks/bellows.md) is an air bladder that when given mechanical power will contract and blow a gust at the 3x3 in front of it, and will expand when the mechanical power is removed.
This gust of air can be used to stoke the fire's of a [Hibachi](../blocks/hibachi.md) to allowing the [Cauldron](../blocks/cauldron.md) to process Stoked Recipes as well as create a [Kiln](../blocks/kiln.md).
